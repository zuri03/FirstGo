# FirstGo

## TODO
- Add token refresh functionality to spotify client
- Start planning web socket
- Add accont manipulation endpoints

## v1.0.0

### Description
- FirstGo is a simple server 
- Since this is my first go project hence the name the main purpose behind the project and it's functionality is learning
- For this project I decided to build something I am familiar with (an http server) while also using a new language with new conpcepts so that I can focus on learning one thing at a time

### Future Plans
- This project started out as an http server, however I would like to expand this further to work with websockets
- Learn to deploy project using docker and containerizaiton
